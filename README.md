Now because I print "do release ..." I upgrade the Ubuntu to 18, I have some mistakes. Maybe I just didn't open the server like mysql or apachectl etc when restart the machine. When I reset system I encounted mistakes while I use apt install apache2 etc, the mistakes show 'E: Failed to fetch http://mirrors.cloud.aliyuncs.com/ubuntu/pool/main/m/mysq.... ',and I tried many time, but failed. 

So I reset the system to Centos7, luckily, I didn't have the same problem here. 

And it is the reason I use Centos in my server now.
